This a fun Madlib style game, that takes in plain text
and removes a proportion of adjectives, nouns, verbs, and adverbs.
Then you're asked to provide a replacement for those terms and the
results are printed to you!
Note: Even after importing spacy, you will need to download a
spacy english vocabulary for this to run. The large library is
used here, but either of the smaller libraries could work.

    This function is written to be used with a map function.
    This function computes the following:
        1) Creates a list of all the tokens of the given part of speech.
        Adds the token.text,token.tag_ and detailed explanation to a list.
        2) Calculates the total number of the pos and takes the floor of one quarter of the results
        3) Creates a random list of words to remove. Amount is based on the result from #2 above.
        4) Searches for the items in the text and adds to the words to a master removal list
        5) Removes pattern for the next loop

    Parameters
    ----------
    pos_type : String. This is the part of speech (token.pos_) you are replacing 

    Returns
    -------
    replace_me : This returns a list of words that will be replaced:

    This takes a list of token of the results from the previous function, which is a list of tuples.
    Takes this list, and asks the user for a part of speech, and uses
    the input to replace a word in that position.

    ----------
